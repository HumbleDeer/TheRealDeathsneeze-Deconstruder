# Deconstruder

Deconstruder is a toolhead for the Voron V0 utilizing the v0.1 carriage and an NF-Crazy hot end, designed around maximizing rigidity while maintaining a small footprint and low mass. There are currently no plans to support other hot ends due to some of the unique features of the NF-Crazy / Mosquito hot end: the ability to use four bolts on two different planes to secure the hot end to the toolhead, the ability to carry a 'fan net' or 'mosquito net' at the bottom of the heatsink frame and the built-in 2510 fan mount saving a fair amount of weight and space over other options.

Deconstruder is identical in width in the X axis, while being shorter in the Z axis than both the mini AfterBurner and mini StealthBurner. It also brings the nozzle higher up with the non-volcano heater block option to aid in optimizing the center of mass as well as reducing the build volume penalty from switching to a volcano heat block. When used with a standard heat block, the nozzle will sit approximately 3mm higher than stock. You may have to adjust the position of your Z rails and endstop for this.

At this point in time, Deconstruder is very experimental. **Print and install at your own risk.** If you do so, please provide feedback. It would be greatly appreciated and will help the project improve!

Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed on the Standard Flow & High Flow duct variants.

## Type 1: High Flow (HF)

For use with the standard block
